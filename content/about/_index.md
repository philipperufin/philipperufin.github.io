I am a Geographer with a focus on Earth Observation and Land System Science. I am currently working at the Earth and Life Institute at UCLouvain, supported by a F.R.S.-FNRS Postdoctoral Fellowship. My research integrates Earth observation and machine learning to map land use across large regions and long time frames. My studies focus on croplands and pastures in consolidated and small-holder systems within tropical and semi-arid regions.
