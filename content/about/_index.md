Geographer interested in linking Land System Science and Earth Observation. My work involves the development and application of methods for large-area mapping of land use and land use intensity based on machine learning. Currently, I´m working on mapping the dynamics of cropland, field size, and land use intensity in Sub-Saharan Africa using deep learning and very high spatial resolution satellite imagery.
